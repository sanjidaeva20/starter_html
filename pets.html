                 Cheeto is a cat who likes to eat a lot and play a lot. He has an obsession with his grandpa (human) and tries to get outside every single day. If he is not causing problems, he is usually hiding in a seven foot tall cat tree and sleeping.  </p>
             <p>
                 Another name for Cheeto is Chicken, because sometimes he sits very scrunched up and ends up looking like a rotisserie chicken. He was nicknamed this by one of his friends, and now he understands it as his own name. He is about six years old and still acts like a younger cat, despite being middle-aged.
